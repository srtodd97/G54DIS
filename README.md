Databases, Interfaces and Software Design coursework

All of the PHP, HTML and CSS scripts that were used to implement the student management system can be found in the 'Student Database Coursework' folder.

To code for the student database homepage is titled 'student_homepage.php' to view this in the browser type in the url mersey.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mbyst4/student_homepage.php. This homepage is only partly active so some of the buttons are linked to other pages and some are inactive. To view the student's module page; under the heading my teaching and click on 'My Modules' tab. This will redirect you to the 'My Modules' page from there a student ID can be entered into the requisite form to view the student's details and what modules they are currently taking. Please type in one of the following student IDs; 390019, 4271008, 4275005, 4294706.

I have also included code for a login and registration page, however I was not able to implement these. The login form can be viewed in the browser mersey.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mbyst4/login_form.php.
